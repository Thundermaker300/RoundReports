# Round Reports
 An SCP:SL Exiled plugin which generates reports at the end of each round, and shares them in your Discord server. Also includes end-of-round broadcasts, with support for over 20 different round statistics displayed in these broadcasts.  This plugin supports Serpent's Hand and UIU Rescue Squad, and will display stats accordingly.
  
This plugin uses [paste.ee](https://paste.ee/) for hosting reports. This service is not affiliated with RoundReports, and they have their own Terms of Service you must abide by when using this plugin. By default, reports automatically expire after 30 days; however, this can be configured, and reports can be saved with a simple tool like the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/).  
  
Important Notes:
* This plugin requires **Newtonsoft.json** in your plugin's dependencies folder in order to work. Click [here](https://github.com/Thundermaker300/RoundReports/releases/download/v0.5.5/Newtonsoft.Json.dll) to download it.
* Statistics from users with Do Not Track (DNT) enabled are treated differently, please see "Note on DNT Players" section below.

## Supported Plugins
* SCP-008-X (User must have "IsScp008" session variable)
* SCP-035  (User must have "IsScp035" session variable)
* Serpent's Hand  (User must have "IsSH" session variable)
* UIU (Unusual Incidents Unit)  (User must have "IsUIU" session variable)

## Note on DNT Players
Players with Do Not Track enabled will never have their username present on reports. How their stats are handled is based on the `ExcludeDNTUsers` config. If this config is set to `true`, no stats at all will be recorded except for kill logs (in which case their name will be removed). If this config is set to `false`, their stats will still be included but their name will be removed. Do Not Track players will never be included in the MVP statistics, regardless of this setting's value.

## MVP Statistic Info
MVP is calculated by granting players points for specific actions. These points can also be taken away by other actions. There are two separate point systems, and as such two separate MVPs: One for SCPs, and one for humans. Full list of actions and the default points they grant or remove below (can be configured).
